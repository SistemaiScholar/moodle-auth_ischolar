The iScholar is a System for Management of Educational Institutions. Some features that iScholar offers are:

As of 2021, we became part of the e-Schooling group, combining our expertise acquired over more than 15 years with the strength of a European group. For more information, click [here](https://ischolar.com.br/).

This plugin allows students and teachers to login on Moodle from a iScholar painel in a secure, fast and convenient way.
